## 📦 Product Passports Implementation

### What Are Product Passports?

Product Passports aggregate multiple attestations about a product into a single, verifiable credential. Think of it as a "digital CV" for products that:
- Combines quality checks, certifications, logistics events, etc.
- Creates a tamper-proof history
- Generates QR codes for easy verification
- Can be anchored to blockchain

### Features Implemented

1. **Passport Creation**
   - Aggregate multiple attestations
   - Automatic credential generation
   - QR code creation
   - Blockchain anchoring support

2. **Passport Management**
   - List user's passports
   - Get passport by ID or product ID
   - Add attestations to existing passports
   - Public verification endpoint

3. **Verification**
   - Verify entire passport validity
   - Check each attestation's blockchain anchor
   - Validate signatures
   - Return detailed verification results

### API Endpoints

```
POST   /api/v1/passports                    Create new passport
GET    /api/v1/passports                    List user passports
GET    /api/v1/passports/:id                Get passport by ID
GET    /api/v1/passports/product/:productId Get by product ID
GET    /api/v1/passports/:id/verify         Verify passport
POST   /api/v1/passports/:id/attestations   Add attestation to passport
```

### Usage Example

```typescript
// Create a product passport
POST /api/v1/passports
{
  "product_id": "LAPTOP-XYZ-2024",
  "name": "Premium Laptop",
  "description": "Complete manufacturing and quality history",
  "attestation_ids": [
    "quality-check-uuid",
    "component-source-uuid",
    "assembly-uuid"
  ],
  "blockchain_network": "stellar"
}

// Response includes:
{
  "id": "passport-uuid",
  "product_id": "LAPTOP-XYZ-2024",
  "aggregated_credential": { ... },
  "qr_code": "data:image/png;base64,...",
  "blockchain_tx_hash": "..."
}

// Verify the passport
GET /api/v1/passports/:id/verify
{
  "valid": true,
  "passport": { ... },
  "attestations_verified": [
    {
      "attestation_id": "...",
      "valid": true,
      "blockchain_verified": true,
      "signature_verified": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔐 Zero-Knowledge Proofs Implementation

### What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

ZK Proofs allow proving statements about data without revealing the data itself. For example:
- Prove age > 18 without revealing exact age
- Prove salary in range without revealing exact amount
- Prove membership in set without revealing which member

### Proof Types Implemented

1. **Threshold Proofs**
   - Prove: value ≥ threshold
   - Example: Prove product quality score ≥ 90/100
   - Privacy: Actual score remains hidden

2. **Range Proofs**
   - Prove: min ≤ value ≤ max
   - Example: Prove temperature was between 2°C and 8°C
   - Privacy: Exact temperature remains hidden

3. **Set Membership Proofs**
   - Prove: value ∈ set
   - Example: Prove component from approved supplier list
   - Privacy: Which supplier remains hidden

### @proofpass/zk-toolkit Package

New package with simplified ZKP implementation:
- `generateThresholdProof()`
- `generateRangeProof()`
- `generateSetMembershipProof()`
- `verifyProof()` - Generic verification

**Note:** This is a simplified MVP implementation. Production should use:
- snarkjs + circom for zk-SNARKs
- bulletproofs-js for bulletproofs
- Or other production-grade ZKP libraries

### API Endpoints

```
POST   /api/v1/zkp/proofs                   Generate ZK proof
GET    /api/v1/zkp/proofs                   List user proofs
GET    /api/v1/zkp/proofs/:id               Get proof by ID
GET    /api/v1/zkp/proofs/:id/verify        Verify proof
GET    /api/v1/attestations/:id/proofs      Get proofs for attestation
```

### Usage Examples

#### Threshold Proof

```typescript
// Prove quality score ≥ 90 without revealing exact score
POST /api/v1/zkp/proofs
{
  "attestation_id": "quality-attestation-uuid",
  "circuit_type": "threshold",
  "private_inputs": {
    "value": 95  // Hidden
  },
  "public_inputs": {
    "threshold": 90  // Public
  }
}

// Response:
{
  "id": "proof-uuid",
  "circuit_type": "threshold",
  "public_inputs": {
    "threshold": 90,
    "commitment": "abc123..."
  },
  "proof": "...",
  "verified": true
}
```

#### Range Proof

```typescript
// Prove temperature was in range without revealing exact value
POST /api/v1/zkp/proofs
{
  "attestation_id": "temp-attestation-uuid",
  "circuit_type": "range",
  "private_inputs": {
    "value": 4.5  // Hidden (actual temperature)
  },
  "public_inputs": {
    "min": 2,     // Public
    "max": 8      // Public
  }
}
```

#### Set Membership Proof

```typescript
// Prove component from approved suppliers without revealing which
POST /api/v1/zkp/proofs
{
  "attestation_id": "component-attestation-uuid",
  "circuit_type": "set_membership",
  "private_inputs": {
    "value": "Supplier-B"  // Hidden
  },
  "public_inputs": {
    "set": ["Supplier-A", "Supplier-B", "Supplier-C"]  // Public (hashed)
  }
}
```

POST /api/v1/attestations
{
  "type": "QualityCheck",
  "subject": "PRODUCT-001",
  "claims": { "score": 95, "inspector": "John" }
}

POST /api/v1/attestations
{
  "type": "ComponentSource",
  "subject": "PRODUCT-001",
  "claims": { "supplier": "Supplier-A" }
}

# 2. Create product passport
POST /api/v1/passports
{
  "product_id": "PRODUCT-001",
  "name": "Premium Product",
  "attestation_ids": ["att1-uuid", "att2-uuid"]
}

# 3. Generate ZK proof about quality (without revealing exact score)

---

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### ZKP Implementation

The current ZKP implementation is **simplified for MVP**:
- Uses hash commitments instead of full zk-SNARKs
- Suitable for demonstration and prototyping
- **NOT cryptographically secure for production**

For production use, replace with:
```bash
npm install snarkjs circom
```

And implement proper circuits in Circom language.

### Database Performance

All necessary indexes already exist:
- `idx_passports_product` on product_id
- `idx_passports_user` on user_id
- `idx_zkproofs_attestation` on attestation_id
- `idx_passport_attestations_*` on junction table

### Bug: Rate limiting not working for unauthenticated requests

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Make 150 requests to /api/v1/health without authentication
2. All requests succeed (should be limited to 100/min)

**Expected:** Requests 101+ should return 429 Too Many Requests
**Actual:** All 150 requests return 200 OK

**Environment:**
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Node: 18.18.0

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.18.0 or higher
- npm 8.0 or higher
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+
- Git

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ProofPassPlatform.git
cd ProofPassPlatform
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your local configuration:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/proofpass_dev
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET=your-development-secret-min-32-chars
API_KEY_SALT=your-development-salt-min-32-chars
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

4. **Set up the database**

```bash
# Create database
createdb proofpass_dev

# Run migrations
cd apps/api
npm run migrate
```

5. **Build packages**

```bash
npm run build
```

6. **Run tests to verify setup**

```bash
npm test
```

7. **Start development server**

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run dev
```

The API should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode enabled** - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Explicit return types** - Always define function return types
- **Interface over type** - Use `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions
- **Meaningful names** - Use descriptive variable and function names

**Good Example:**
```typescript
export async function createAttestation(
  data: CreateAttestationDTO,
  userId: string
): Promise<Attestation> {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Bad Example:**
```typescript
export async function create(d: any, u: string) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

**Key Rules:**
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Quotes: Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons: Required
- Line length: 100 characters max
- Trailing commas: Required for multi-line

### Architecture Patterns

Follow the established patterns:

1. **Layered Architecture**
   - Routes ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Data Access
   - No business logic in routes
   - No database queries in routes

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Pass dependencies as parameters
   - Avoid global state

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use custom error classes
   - Never expose internal errors to clients

4. **Security First**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize outputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Follow principle of least privilege

See [API_ARCHITECTURE.md](API_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architectural guidelines.

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `chore`: Other changes (dependencies, etc.)

### Examples

**Feature:**
```
feat(zkp): add range proof circuit

Implement range proof generation and verification for ZK proofs.
The circuit validates that a value falls within a specified range
without revealing the actual value.

Closes #123
```

**Bug Fix:**
```
fix(rate-limit): correct Redis key expiration

Redis keys were not expiring correctly, causing rate limits to
persist indefinitely. Fixed by using pExpire with milliseconds.

Fixes #456
```

**Documentation:**
```
docs(security): add SQL injection prevention guide

Add detailed documentation on how ProofPass prevents SQL injection
attacks through parameterized queries and input validation.
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

Use JSDoc comments for all public APIs:

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new attestation and anchors it to the blockchain
 *
 * @param data - Attestation data including type and claims
 * @param userId - ID of the user creating the attestation
 * @returns Promise resolving to the created attestation
 * @throws {ValidationError} If attestation data is invalid
 * @throws {InternalError} If blockchain anchoring fails
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const attestation = await createAttestation({
 *   type: 'certification',
 *   claims: { certId: 'CERT-123' }
 * }, userId);
 * ```
 */
export async function createAttestation(
  data: CreateAttestationDTO,
  userId: string
): Promise<Attestation> {
  // Implementation
}
```

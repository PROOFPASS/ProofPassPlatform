## Executive Summary

**ProofPass Platform** is an open-source, blockchain-based system for creating, managing, and verifying digital attestations, product passports, and zero-knowledge proofs. Designed as a Digital Public Good, ProofPass enables transparent, verifiable credential systems that promote trust, transparency, and accountability across supply chains, certifications, and digital identity systems.

### Why ProofPass Matters

- **Transparency:** All attestations are anchored to public blockchains, ensuring immutability and public verifiability
- **Privacy-Preserving:** Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification without revealing sensitive data
- **Interoperable:** Based on W3C Verifiable Credentials standard, ensuring compatibility
- **Accessible:** Free and open-source, deployable anywhere without vendor lock-in
- **Scalable:** Designed for global use, from small businesses to large organizations

### Key Impact Areas

- **Supply Chain Transparency** - Track product authenticity and ethical sourcing
- **Digital Identity** - Enable verifiable credentials for education, employment, and certification
- **Anti-Counterfeiting** - Prove product authenticity without revealing trade secrets
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Demonstrate compliance through verifiable attestations
- **Financial Inclusion** - Enable trust in digital transactions for underserved populations

- No centralized tracking or surveillance capabilities
- Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for privacy
- Zero-knowledge proofs prevent data leakage
- Open-source (auditable by anyone)
- Privacy-preserving by design

#### C. Centralization Risks

**Potential Harm:** Single point of control or failure

**Mitigation:**

- Open-source (anyone can fork and run)
- No vendor lock-in (portable)
- Self-hostable (no dependency on central service)
- Standard-based (interoperable)

#### D. Digital Divide

**Potential Harm:** Excluding populations without technical resources

**Mitigation:**
- Low infrastructure requirements (runs on $5/month VPS)
- Offline verification via QR codes
- Simple REST API (easy integration)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Free and open-source (no licensing costs)
- Community support

#### E. Counterfeiting/Fraud

**Potential Harm:** False attestations undermining trust

**Mitigation:**
- Blockchain anchoring (immutable)
- Cryptographic signatures (tamper-proof)
- Public verification (anyone can verify)
- Issuer accountability (traceable to source)
- Audit trails (complete history)

**Ongoing Harm Assessment:**
- Regular security audits
- Community feedback mechanisms

ProofPass generates credentials compliant with the W3C VC Data Model:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "CertificationCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:proofpass:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "issuanceDate": "2024-10-28T12:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "PRODUCT-12345",
    "type": "Product",
    "certificationId": "CERT-12345",
    "issuedBy": "Acme Corp"
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2024-10-28T12:00:00Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:proofpass:550e8400#keys-1",
    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9..."
  }
}
```

**Compliance:**
- ✅ Standard @context
- ✅ Required type fields
- ✅ Issuer DID
- ✅ IssuanceDate (ISO 8601)
- ✅ CredentialSubject structure
- ✅ Proof object (signature)

## Privacy and Data Protection

### Privacy Principles

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Only collect necessary data
   - No analytics or tracking
   - User controls data retention

2. **Purpose Limitation**
   - Data used only for stated purpose
   - No secondary use without consent
   - Clear privacy policy

3. **Storage Limitation**
   - Configurable retention periods
   - Automatic deletion options
   - Export before deletion (data portability)

4. **Transparency**
   - Clear data practices
   - User access to their data
   - Audit logs for data access

### GDPR Compliance

**Article 15 - Right to Access:**
- API endpoint to export all user data
- JSON format for portability

**Article 16 - Right to Rectification:**
- Update endpoints for user data
- Immutable blockchain records noted

**Article 17 - Right to Erasure:**
- Delete account endpoint
- Blockchain records remain (anonymized identifiers)
- Personal data removed

**Article 20 - Right to Data Portability:**
- Export functionality (JSON, CSV)
- Standard formats (W3C VC)

**Article 32 - Security of Processing:**
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access controls
- Regular security audits

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Enable privacy-preserving verification:

**Example:** Prove age ≥ 18 without revealing birth date
```
Traditional: "Birth date: 1990-05-15" → Reveals exact age
ZK Proof: "Threshold proof: age ≥ 18" → Only reveals eligibility
```

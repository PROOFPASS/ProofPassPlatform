## 📚 Documentation by Topic

### Core Concepts

#### What is ProofPass?
ProofPass is a blockchain-based platform for creating, managing, and verifying digital attestations, product passports, and zero-knowledge proofs.

**Key Features:**
- W3C Verifiable Credentials
- Product Passports (aggregated attestations)
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (privacy-preserving)
- Blockchain anchoring (Stellar)
- Enterprise-grade security

**Learn More:** [../README.md](../README.md)

#### Architecture Overview
ProofPass follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **API Layer:** Fastify REST API
- **Business Logic:** Service layer
- **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Blockchain:** Stellar network

**Deep Dive:** [architecture/API_ARCHITECTURE.md](architecture/API_ARCHITECTURE.md)
